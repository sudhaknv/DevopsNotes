1 ec2 instance in public subnet can be connected from internet..
1 ect instance in private subnet cannot be connected from internet..
Publice subet will have route to internet where as private subnet wonthave any..

Create vpc -->name (our wish)-->ipv4 cidr(10.200.0.0/16) and create, next immediately we have to associate vpc 	to internet gateways so that vpc can talk to internet.
**********select VPC-->Actions (edit dns hostname) and enable it...

Create internet gateways -->Name(ourwish)-->Attach to VPC -->Yes i am in..

Create Public Subnet -->Name (ourwish)-->Selecte right vpc-->AvailabiltyZone(we can select or leaveit)--->IPV4 CIDR block(10.200.0.0/24)-->Create.

If we want to create public subnet (we have to create route table and then assign this to public subnet)

Route table-->Name(publicRT A)-->VPC(select right VPC)-->we have to add a route to internet (by default route table can enter into only local VPC not from outside)
to enable to and fro internet "Route"-->EDIT-->(0.0.0.0/0  and select internet gateway which was created) and make sure its associated to subnet associations
subnet associations -->Edit(select subnet) -->save

Create Private Subnet-->Name (ourwish)-->Selecte right vpc-->AvailabiltyZone(we can select or leaveit)--->IPV4 CIDR block(10.200.1.0/24)-->Create.
Route table-->Name(privateRT A)-->VPC(select right VPC)-->we dont have to add it to  route to internet as we want as private RT and it shouldnt get connected to internet..
Make Sure to associate to subnet associations """subnet associations -->Edit(select subnet) -->save"""

Creating instance in public subnet and private subet
Launch Instance--->Network(select created VPC)-->subnet(slect created public subnet)--->Auto assign publicIP (Enable)-->rest all same-->Security grp(nstead of custom slect myip) and done
Private Instance -->Network(select created VPC)-->subnet(slect created public subnet)--->Auto assign publicIP (disable) -->rest all same-->Security grp(custom -->10.200.0.0/24 publicsubnetrange of from which instance we want to connect)  
All ICMP -->custom -->10.200.0.0/24 publicsubnetrange from which instance we want to connect)    

We want keypair to login from public to private subnet:
In public net ec2--->VI demo.pem(copy paste content inside keypair pem file),change permissions and connect from Public to private instance)



As per architecture
 we have to communicate from ec2 B to ec2 A-->we cant open or do ssh directly to Ec2 B from internet as its private Subnet but we should be able to get connected from EC2 A.
we will open complete subnet from public so that any instances in public can talk to private subnet...
